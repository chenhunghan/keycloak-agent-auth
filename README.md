# Keycloak Agent Auth Protocol Extension

A Keycloak extension implementing the [Agent Auth Protocol v1.0-draft](https://agent-auth-protocol.com/), which establishes AI agents as first-class principals with their own identity, scoped capabilities, and independent lifecycle.

## Why Keycloak?

Keycloak already runs the things Agent Auth needs: realms, users, sessions, tokens, audit events, and an admin API. This extension layers agent-auth concepts (hosts, agents, capability grants) on top, reusing Keycloak's user identity, approval UX, and event log instead of building parallel machinery. Approval flows (device-authorization §7.1, CIBA push §7.2) ride on Keycloak user sessions; multi-tenant capability registries ride on Keycloak Organizations and realm roles, with org-leave events triggering grant revocation.

## Architecture

**Hybrid model** — Keycloak handles auth; the resource server handles capability execution.

```mermaid

    Agent["Agent<br/>(the AI)"]
    Client["Client<br/>(your CLI / SDK)"]
    KC["Keycloak<br/>(this extension)"]
    RS["Resource Server"]

    Agent <-->|tools| Client
    Client -->|agent-auth protocol| KC
    KC -.->|gateway proxy| RS
    Client -.->|direct call| RS
    RS -.->|introspect| KC
```

The **Client** is the process that holds the host keypair, signs JWTs, and speaks the agent-auth protocol — your CLI, SDK, or background worker. The **Agent** is the AI reasoning loop running inside the Client; it requests capabilities through tool calls (MCP, SDK functions) and never talks to Keycloak directly.

Solid edges always happen; dashed edges are mode-specific. Host-scoped calls (register, status, revoke, rotate-key) carry a `host+jwt`; agent-scoped calls (execute, introspect) carry an `agent+jwt`. Per-endpoint paths and auth are below; the end-to-end sequence diagram lives in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

### Endpoints

Endpoints are grouped by who calls them. Two SPI roots host all paths; each subsection states its base.

- **Realm-scoped:** `/realms/{realm}/agent-auth/` — protocol traffic from clients, agents, end users, and resource servers.
- **Admin-scoped:** `/admin/realms/{realm}/agent-auth/` — administrative endpoints requiring `manage-realm` (realm admin) or `manage-organization` (org admin).
- **Discovery** uses Keycloak's standard well-known mechanism, not the agent-auth path: `GET /realms/{realm}/.well-known/agent-configuration`.

#### Liveness (anyone)

Base: `/realms/{realm}/agent-auth/`

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `health` | Liveness probe; confirms the extension is loaded |

#### Client / SDK (host or agent JWT)

Base: `/realms/{realm}/agent-auth/`. Host-scoped calls carry a `host+jwt`; agent-scoped calls carry an `agent+jwt`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `agent/register` | Register agent under a host |
| GET  | `agent/status` | Check agent status + grants |
| GET  | `agent/{agentId}/capabilities/{capabilityName}/status` | Poll a pending grant while it awaits approval |
| POST | `agent/revoke` | Permanently revoke an agent |
| POST | `agent/reactivate` | Reactivate an expired agent |
| POST | `agent/rotate-key` | Replace agent's public key (host+jwt signed with the host key) |
| POST | `agent/request-capability` | Request additional capabilities |
| POST | `host/revoke` | Revoke host + cascade to all agents |
| POST | `host/rotate-key` | Replace host's public key (signed with the old key) |
| GET  | `capability/list` | List available capabilities |
| GET  | `capability/describe` | Get full capability schema |
| POST | `capability/execute` | Gateway execution: Keycloak introspects the agent JWT, runs constraint checks, and proxies to `capability.location` |

#### Resource server

Base: `/realms/{realm}/agent-auth/`

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `agent/introspect` | Validate an agent JWT (RFC 7662 model). Optional `{capability, arguments}` runs constraint checks server-side. |

#### End user (browser approval flow)

Base: `/realms/{realm}/agent-auth/`. All endpoints require an authenticated realm user (Keycloak identity cookie or `Authorization: Bearer <user-access-token>`).

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET  | `verify` | Browser-facing HTML approval page (the URL published as `verification_uri`). Bounces through realm login when no fresh identity cookie, then renders an approval form bound to the supplied `user_code`. |
| POST | `verify` | Form-encoded companion to the page: `user_code + decision + access_token` → HTML success/failure page. CSRF double-submit. |
| POST | `verify/approve` | JSON approve (§7.1). Activates the agent and links the host to the approving user. The entitlement gate flips grants whose cap fails the user's org/role check to `denied(insufficient_authority)`. |
| POST | `verify/deny` | JSON deny. Terminal — subsequent approve attempts return 410. |
| GET  | `inbox` | Pending approvals routed to the user via CIBA push (§7.2). In-realm fallback when SMTP isn't configured. |

#### Realm admin (`manage-realm`)

Base: `/admin/realms/{realm}/agent-auth/`

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST   | `capabilities` | Register a realm-wide capability |
| PUT    | `capabilities/{name}` | Update a realm-wide capability |
| DELETE | `capabilities/{name}` | Delete a realm-wide capability |
| POST   | `hosts` | Pre-register a host with an inline Ed25519 JWK (§2.8). Optional `client_id` resolves a service-account user as the host owner so autonomous workloads skip the post-claim approval flow. |
| GET    | `hosts/{id}` | Fetch a host record by thumbprint |
| POST   | `hosts/{id}/link` | Bind host → user (§2.9). Cascades: autonomous agents → `claimed` with grants revoked (§2.10); delegated agents inherit `user_id` (§3.2). |
| DELETE | `hosts/{id}/link` | Remove the host→user binding. Revokes delegated agents; autonomous agents stay `claimed` (terminal). |
| GET    | `agents/{id}` | Fetch an agent record by id |
| GET    | `agents/{id}/grants` | Rows from the `AGENT_AUTH_AGENT_GRANT` secondary index — verifies the index stays in sync with the per-agent grant blob |
| POST   | `agents/{id}/capabilities/{capability}/approve` | Approve a pending capability grant |
| POST   | `agents/{id}/expire` | Force-expire an active agent |
| POST   | `agents/{id}/reject` | Reject a pending agent (terminal) |
| POST   | `pending-agents/cleanup` | Manual GC sweep for stale pending agents and the orphan pending hosts left behind by abandoned dynamic registrations. Also runs hourly per JVM. Optional `?olderThanSeconds=` overrides the default threshold. Returns `{removed, removed_agents, removed_hosts, threshold_seconds}` (`removed` is the sum). |

#### Org admin (`manage-organization` + member of the target org)

Base: `/admin/realms/{realm}/agent-auth/`. `organization_id` is derived from the path; the body can't override it. Cross-org PUT/DELETE returns 404.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST   | `organizations/{orgId}/capabilities` | Register an org-scoped capability |
| GET    | `organizations/{orgId}/capabilities` | List org-scoped capabilities |
| PUT    | `organizations/{orgId}/capabilities/{name}` | Update an org-scoped capability |
| DELETE | `organizations/{orgId}/capabilities/{name}` | Delete an org-scoped capability |
| POST   | `organizations/{orgId}/hosts` | Pre-register a host. Org-admin counterpart to `POST /hosts` — resolves `client_id` against a service-account user already in the org so the host inherits org-membership cascades. |
| POST   | `organizations/{orgId}/agent-environments` | Self-serve provisioning: creates a locked-down confidential client (no redirect URIs, only `client_credentials`), adds its service-account user to the org, and pre-registers the host. Returns `client_secret` once. Cap: 50 managed clients per org. |
| GET    | `organizations/{orgId}/agent-environments` | List managed agent-environment clients |
| DELETE | `organizations/{orgId}/agent-environments/{clientId}` | Delete a managed agent-environment client and its host record |

### What the resource server does

The resource server hosts each capability's business logic at the URL stored in `capability.location`. It can be written in any language. For each request it should verify the JWT `aud` matches its own capability URL, call Keycloak's `POST /agent/introspect` with `{"token":"..."}` (or `{"token":"...","capability":"...","arguments":{...}}` to run constraint checks server-side), and reject when `active` is `false` or `violations` is present and non-empty. Resource servers that don't want to implement introspection can use **gateway** mode instead and let Keycloak proxy.

### Execution modes

The agent picks per call:

- **Gateway** — `POST /capability/execute` to Keycloak with `{capability, arguments}`. Keycloak introspects the agent JWT, runs constraint checks, and proxies to `capability.location`. The resource server doesn't need to introspect. Synchronous, async-pending (`202 + status_url`), and SSE streaming responses are all proxied.
- **Direct** — `POST` straight to `capability.location` with the agent JWT in `Authorization`. The resource server calls `/agent/introspect` itself. Useful when the resource server already runs its own auth or wants to avoid an extra hop.

### Protocol actors

The spec defines five actors; this extension implements one (Server). The others plug in around Keycloak.

| Actor | Role | Implementation note |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **Agent** (§2.1) | Runtime AI actor scoped to a conversation/task. Doesn't hold keys itself. | Yours — any LLM/runtime. Lifecycle states: `pending`, `active`, `expired`, `revoked`, `rejected`, `claimed`. |
| **Client** (§1.5) | Process that holds the host keypair, exposes protocol tools (MCP/CLI/SDK) to agents, signs JWTs, and speaks HTTP to the server. | Yours — any language. One client install ≡ one host identity. |
| **Host** (§2.7) | Persistent identity of the client environment (Ed25519 keypair + metadata). A principal the client holds, not an actor. | Stored in `AGENT_AUTH_HOST`. |
| **Server** (§1.5) | Authorization server: discovery, registration, approvals, grants, introspection, gateway execution. | **This extension + Keycloak core.** |
| **Resource server** (§1.5, §2.15) | Hosts a capability's business logic at `capability.location`. Validates agent JWTs locally or via `/agent/introspect`. | Yours — any language. |
| **User** (implicit) | Human who approves delegated registrations and grants. | A Keycloak realm user. Hosts get bound to users via the admin link API or implicitly when the user approves a device-flow registration; CIBA emails the linked user a deep link to the approval page. |

## Capabilities

Capabilities are registered in Keycloak by administrators. Keycloak is the single source of truth for what capabilities exist, who can see them, and which agents have grants.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Admin["Admin"]
    KC["Keycloak<br/>(capability registry)"]
    Client["Agent / Client"]

    Admin -->|register capability| KC
    KC -->|discover| Client
```

Each capability record carries:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Stable identifier (`check_balance`, `transfer_money`) |
| `description` | Human-readable explanation |
| `location` | URL where the resource server executes the capability. If omitted, clients fall back to `default_location` from discovery (§2.15 / §5.1). Capabilities without a location appear in discovery and grants but can't be proxied through gateway mode. |
| `input` / `output` | JSON Schema for arguments and results |
| `visibility` *(extension)* | `public` (visible to anyone) or `authenticated` (visible to realm users only) |
| `requires_approval` *(extension)* | Whether user approval is needed before granting |
| `organization_id` | Optional Keycloak organization id. When set, only that org's members can see or be granted the cap. NULL = realm-wide. |
| `required_role` | Optional realm role name. When set, only callers holding the role can be granted. NULL = no role gate. |

### Multi-tenant scoping

`organization_id` and `required_role` compose into one entitlement gate: a caller passes when both `(cap.organization_id IS NULL OR caller ∈ cap's org)` and `(cap.required_role IS NULL OR caller has cap.required_role)` hold. Public-visibility caps bypass the gate (anonymous callers have nothing to match against).

The gate runs at three points:

- **Discovery** — `/capability/list` and `/capability/describe` filter caps the caller can't see.
- **Approval** — `/verify/approve` flips grants whose cap fails the approver's entitlement to `denied(insufficient_authority)`; passing grants go `active`.
- **Introspection** — `/agent/introspect` strips grants whose cap the agent's user no longer entitles (the lazy half of the cascade).

The eager half: `OrganizationModel.OrganizationMemberLeaveEvent` triggers immediate revocation of a leaving user's grants whose cap belongs to that org, with `reason=org_membership_removed`.

The Keycloak Organizations feature is required for org-scoped caps end-to-end. Without it, caps with `organization_id IS NULL` continue to work; caps with a set `organization_id` become invisible (fail-safe — no leakage when the feature isn't enabled).

### Constraints

Grants can carry constraints that restrict what arguments the agent can supply:

```json
{
  "capability": "transfer_money",
  "status": "active",
  "constraints": {
    "amount": { "min": 0, "max": 1000 },
    "currency": { "in": ["USD", "EUR"] },
    "destination_account": "acc_456"
  }
}
```

Supported operators: `max`, `min`, `in`, `not_in`, and exact-value match. Constraints run in two places — gateway-mode `/capability/execute` (returns `403 constraint_violated`) and `/agent/introspect` when the resource server passes `{token, capability, arguments}` (returns a `violations[]` array).

### Auto-grant

Two orthogonal signals can skip the user-approval prompt for a delegated agent's grant:

- **Per-cap `requires_approval=false`** — admin marks this cap as universally low-risk.
- **Per-host `default_capabilities`** — a set of cap names on the host record, populated when prior grants get approved. A subsequent registration under the same host that requests a cap already in the set auto-approves (§3.1, §5.3 auto-approval rule).

A grant auto-approves when the entitlement gate passes AND (`!requires_approval` OR cap is in the host's `default_capabilities`).

## Identity and keys

Hosts and agents use Ed25519 keypairs. Registration provides keys either inline as a public JWK (`host_public_key`, `agent_public_key`) or by reference with a JWKS URL (`host_jwks_url`, `agent_jwks_url`). Inline and JWKS URL are mutually exclusive per identity, and `agent_kid` is required when `agent_jwks_url` is used.

JWKS-based identities are cached in-process for 5 minutes. A `kid` miss triggers one refetch per URL, rate-limited to once per 10 seconds. JWKS fetches require HTTPS, except for localhost and container-test hostnames used by local development and integration tests — intentionally stricter than the spec's URL-fetching guidance.

Inline-key identities rotate through the explicit endpoints (`/agent/rotate-key`, `/host/rotate-key`); JWKS-based identities rotate by publishing the new key at the JWKS URL.

This extension does not sign protocol responses, so discovery does not publish a server `jwks_uri` and `/agent-auth/jwks` is not exposed. Host and agent JWKS support is independent of any future server-response signing.

## Key design decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Architecture | Hybrid (Keycloak does auth, resource server executes) | Avoids building a parallel auth system inside Keycloak. |
| Discovery | `/realms/{realm}/.well-known/agent-configuration` via `WellKnownProvider` SPI | Follows Keycloak's OpenID discovery pattern. |
| Crypto | Nimbus JOSE+JWT for Ed25519 | Already on Keycloak's classpath, well-audited. |
| Storage | JPA entities + Liquibase changelog via `JpaEntityProvider` SPI; writes land in Keycloak's main persistence unit (H2 in dev, any RDBMS Keycloak supports in prod). Selected by default through the `agent-auth-storage` SPI; set `kc.spi.agent-auth-storage.provider=in-memory` to switch back to the process-local map for tests. | Survives Keycloak restarts and scales across replicas. Indexed `ORGANIZATION_ID` and `REQUIRED_ROLE` make multi-tenant filtering and cascades SQL-efficient. The `AGENT_AUTH_AGENT_GRANT` table is a sync-on-write secondary index over per-agent grants used by the eager cascade. |
| Approval flows | Device-authorization (§7.1), CIBA push (§7.2 — email + in-realm `/inbox` fallback), and admin-mediated HTTP approval | Device flow reuses the realm's user authentication for the `user_code` step; CIBA emails the linked user a deep link to `/verify/approve`; the admin path covers headless setups. |
| Capabilities | Centralized in Keycloak, optionally org-scoped | Single source of truth; resource servers just execute. Multi-tenancy via Keycloak Organizations + realm roles. |

## Protocol reference

This extension implements [Agent Auth Protocol v1.0-draft](https://agent-auth-protocol.com/specification).

- **Host** — persistent identity of the client environment (Ed25519 keypair).
- **Agent** — per-task identity scoped to a conversation, with its own keypair, lifecycle, and grants.
- **`host+jwt` / `agent+jwt`** — short-lived Ed25519-signed JWTs (EdDSA, RFC 8037). `host+jwt` audiences the issuer URL. `agent+jwt` audiences the resolved capability location (`capability.location` if set, else `default_location`) when calling for execution, and the issuer URL for non-execution calls to the auth server, per §4.3.
- **Delegated mode** — agent acts on behalf of a user who approves grants.
- **Autonomous mode** — agent operates without a user in the loop (typically backed by a service-account host).
- **Approval methods advertised in discovery** — `device_authorization`, `ciba` (both core spec methods), plus `admin` (server-defined per §5.1's "additional custom methods" allowance).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker (for integration tests)

### Build

```bash
mvn package -Pquick   # compile + package, skip tests
mvn test              # unit tests
mvn verify            # unit + integration tests (starts Keycloak in Docker)
```

### Commit messages

This repository uses Conventional Commits. Install the hook to enforce locally:

```bash
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

The hook rejects commit subjects that don't match `feat: ...`, `fix(scope): ...`, etc. Releases and changelog generation are handled by release-please; release-asset uploads are verified in GitHub Actions.

### Local development with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

Keycloak comes up at `http://localhost:28080` with the extension preloaded. Agent-auth endpoints live at `/realms/{realm}/agent-auth/...`.

The Dockerfile is multi-stage. The builder runs `mvn package` against the checked-in source; the runtime stage copies the extension JAR plus its runtime libs (nimbus-jose-jwt, tink) from `target/provider-libs/` into `/opt/keycloak/providers/`. No host JDK or Maven required. Integration tests use the same `target/provider-libs/` directory via Testcontainers, so the image and the test harness share one source of truth for runtime deps.
